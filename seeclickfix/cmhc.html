<h1>Talk to CMHC</h1>

<p>See a broken chair? A bathroom that needs servicing? Graffiti that needs removal? Now you can help report non-emergency problems you find at the Connecticut Mental Health Center directly to staff, from your smartphone or a computer, thanks to our new partnership with SeeClickFix. 
<p>CMHC staff responds to SeeClickFix requests during regular business hours. If this report comes in on a holiday, weekend or after-hours, it will be read on the next business day. PLEASE NOTE: SeeClickFix is not to be used for emergencies. For urgent matters that require immediate attention or a police response, <span style="color:red;">call 9-1-1</span>.</p>

<p>The widget below allows you to make service requests, as well as track existing reports, from your computer.</p>

<p>Once you have sent a report, you should receive email communication from CMHC staff acknowledging your service request. You can continue to check on the status of the issue online.  Once the work is complete or the issue has been resolved, you will be notified by email as well.</p>
